Local Development
-----------------

You can run this Jekyll site on your local machine. First grab the repository from GitHub, by running this in your terminal from the parent folder where you want to save the repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:runemadsen/news.git
```

Then `cd` into the repository, install `Bundler`, and install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd news
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

Now you can run Jekyll:

```bash
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

You can now go to `localhost:4000` in your browser, and see the site.
